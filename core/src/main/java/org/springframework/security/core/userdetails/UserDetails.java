 * objects. This allows non-security related user information (such as email addresses,
 * telephone numbers etc) to be stored in a convenient location.

 * Concrete implementations must take particular care to ensure the non-null contract
 * detailed for each method is enforced. See
 * {@link org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User} for a reference
 * implementation (which you might like to extend or use in your code).
